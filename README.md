# zendesk-ticketify

This is a challenge from Zendesk to make an app that can view all and single tickets.

# Installation and usage

To install, fork this github repo. To run the app, move into the directory and type 'ruby app.rb' into your terminal. You will be prompted for credentials which will be provided upon request. From there you may type '1' to view all tickets or '2' to be prompted to choose a ticket you would like to view.
